# fcp

Copy data from/to a farcaster hub

## Install

- Binaries: [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/vrypan/fcp/releases)
- From source: Clone the repo, and run `make`. Copy the generated binaries `fcp` and `fcp-inspect` to a location in your $PATH.
- macOS/Homebrew: `brew install vrypan/fcp/fcp`

## Use

- `fcp --help` to see all options.

- Copy fname's casts, reactions and links from your hub to a local file:
`fcp fc://hubble.local:2283/fname localfile.data`

- Upload the local file to your hub: `fcp localfile.data fc://hubble.local:2283`
(It will fail, because the messages already exist in the hub)

- Use fc+ssl if the hub is using SSL: `fcp fc+ssl://hubble.local:2283/fname localfile.data`

- Re-sign messages with a new signer before uploading: `fcp local.data fc+ssl://hubble.local:2283/fname --app-key=0x...`

### Examining local files

The files generated by `fcp` are binary files containing the marshaled
protobuf responses from the hub.

- Convert to json: `fcp-inspect localfile.data`
- Print out only stats about the file: `fcp-inspect localfile.data --stats`
