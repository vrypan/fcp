# fcp

Copy data from/to a farcaster hub

## Install

- Binaries: [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/vrypan/fcp/releases)
- From source: Clone the repo, and run `make local`. Copy the generated binary `fcp` to a location in your $PATH.
- macOS/Homebrew: `brew install vrypan/fcp/fcp`

## Use

Copy fname's casts, reactions and links from your hub to a local file:

`fcp fc://hubble.local:2283/fname localfile.data`

Upload the local file to your hub:

(It will fail, because the messages already exist in the hub)

`fcp localfile.data fc://hubble.local:2283`

Use fc+ssl if the hub is using SSL:

`fcp fc+ssl://hubble.local:2283/fname localfile.data`

When uploading data, you can use a new signer to resign all messages:

`fcp local.data fc+ssl://hubble.local:2283/fname --app-key=0x...`

### Examining local files

The files generated by `fcp` are binary files containing the marshaled
protobuf responses from the hub.

Use -i to inspect a data file generated by fcp.

This will print out the contents of the file in json format:
`fcp -i localfile.data`

And this will print out only stats about the file:
`fcp -i localfile.data --stats`
