# fcp

Copy data from/to a farcaster hub

## Usage

Copy fname's casts, reactions and links from your hub to a local file:

`fcp fc://hubble.local:2283/fname localfile.data`

Upload the local file to your hub:

`fcp localfile.data fc://hubble.local:2283`

Use fc+ssl if the hub is using SSL:

`fcp fc+ssl://hubble.local:2283/fname localfile.data`

When uploading data, you can use a new signer to resign all messages:

`fcp local.data fc+ssl://hubble.local:2283/fname --app-key=0x...`

## Examining local files

The files generated by `fcp` are binary files containing the marshaled
protobuf responses from the hub.

Use -i to inspect a data file generated by fcp.

This will print out the contents of the file in json format:
`fcp -i localfile.data`

And this will print out only stats about the file:
`fcp -i localfile.data --stats`
